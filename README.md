# Workout Wizards

## Description
    Workout Wizards is a user-friendly web app designed to help you track and discover new exercises, regardless of your fitness level. Users can create personalized workout lists by adding exercises, specifying muscle groups, and scheduling workout dates. Navigate the "Exercises" page to explore or add your favorites, and view all your workouts organized by date and muscle group on the "Workouts" page. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned gym-goer, Workout Wizards is your go-to fitness companion!  

    In this project, we integrated various front-end and back-end technologies like CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Handlebars, and Third-Party APIs to build a fully functional web application. We utilized a GitHub TaskBoard to manage individual and team tasks efficiently, which enhanced our skills in project management, collaboration, and communication. This experience not only helped us develop a robust application but also strengthened our ability to work as a cohesive team in a collaborative environment.
